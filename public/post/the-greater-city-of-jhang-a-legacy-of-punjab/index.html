                <p>Jhang, often perceived today as a modest town near Faisalabad, carries a rich historical legacy that contrasts its current image. Ironically, Faisalabad itself was once just a Tehsil of Jhang. Known for its deep cultural roots, Jhang is situated between two major rivers, the Jhelum and Chenab, which not only enhance its geographical importance but also contribute to its long-standing historical significance. In fact, Jhang is often regarded as the geographical center of Pakistan. In fact, much of the long-distance travels took place via Jhang before the motorways were a thing.</p>
<p>The Trimmu Barrage, where the Jhelum and Chenab rivers meet, is an important landmark further cementing the city&rsquo;s historical and strategic importance. The earliest references to Jhang date back to 325 BC, mentioned in Alexander the Great’s biography. After defeating King Porus, Alexander and his army are recorded to have encamped in the city for nearly six months, marking one of the first foreign incursions into the region.</p>
<p>In the 7th century, the city was noted again in the writings of Xuanzang, a Chinese traveler and scholar. Despite its strategic location, the region’s susceptibility to flooding from the rivers made permanent settlement challenging for much of its history. It wasn’t until the 13th century that Rai Sial, a descendant of the Rajput dynasty, established a settlement, marking the beginning of the Sial dynasty’s rule in the area.</p>
<p>Under the Sial rule, especially during the reign of Mal Khan, Jhang expanded significantly, and at its peak in the 16th and 17th centuries, the region’s territory stretched from Layyah, Multan, and Dera Ghazi Khan to Lahore and Sheikhupura, making it one of the largest districts in the Indian Subcontinent. The Sials ruled Punjab for over 350 years, which was marked by vast expansions and its peak territories of Jhang stretched from Multan to Lahore. But by the 17th century, Jhang fell under the control of the Mughal Empire, followed by the Afghan Empire. In the late 1700s, Ranjit Singh, the leader of the Sikh Empire, visited Jhang and met with Rai Ahmad Khan Kharal, a prominent local figure. Ranjit Singh later annexed Jhang, ruling it for around 40 years.</p>
<p>After the death of Raja Ranjit Singh, the British Raj took control of the region, and Jhang became part of the expanding British Empire. During the War of Independence in 1857, Nawab Ahmad Khan Kharal led a significant uprising, known as the Jatt Rebellion, which saw 125,000 men rise from Multan to Lahore. Nawab Kharal’s phrase gained recognition when he denied aid to the British soldiers: “We do not share our women, horses and land with anyone”. The British colonial administration divided the region into smaller administrative units, including the creation of the Tehsil of Lyallpur in 1886, which later became Faisalabad in 1979, named after King Faisal of Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>In the 20th century, Jhang&rsquo;s boundaries were further expanded to include several neighboring Tehsils such as Layyah, Shorkot, Toba Tek Singh, Samundri, Sahiwal, Sargodha, and Pindi Bhattian, as well as the iconic Sangala Hills making it one of the largest districts of the time. The city of Jhang is also renowned as the birthplace of legendary figures in literature and science. It is home to the famous folk tale &ldquo;Heer Ranjha,&rdquo; a quintessential symbol of Punjabi culture. Additionally, Jhang gave birth to Dr. Abdus Salam, a Nobel laureate in Physics, and the mystic poet Sultan Bahu, whose contributions to Sufism are still revered, with over 40 books and writings to his name.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, after the Partition in 1947, Jhang, like many other smaller towns in Pakistan, suffered neglect from local politicians. In the 1970s and 1980s, Jhang became embroiled in sectarian violence, a dark chapter that plagued the city for over two decades, effects of which can still be felt.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, Jhang remains one of the oldest and culturally rich cities in Punjab, with a heritage that spans millennia. While it may still be considered a relatively underdeveloped area today, its historical significance, cultural richness, and contributions to literature, science, and mysticism remain a vital part of Pakistan&rsquo;s identity. Jhang&rsquo;s journey from an ancient settlement to a modern-day city reflects the resilience of its people and the enduring legacy of its past.</p>
<p>All in all, Jhang&rsquo;s historical and cultural significance cannot be overstated. From its early days the city has been at the crossroads of various empires and civilizations. Despite modern challenges, Jhang&rsquo;s rich heritage, literary contributions, and the legacies of figures like Dr. Abdus Salam continue to shine through. It stands as a testament to the enduring power of history and culture, reminding us of the deep roots that shape present-day Pakistan. To conclude, such heritage should be celebrated and remembered.</p>
