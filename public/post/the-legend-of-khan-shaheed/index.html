                <p>“The very ink with which history is written is merely fluid prejudice&quot;. It is infuriating and dispiriting at the same time that this man is not celebrated enough in Pakistan.</p>
<p>A free thinker, a phastun revolutionary, a freedom fighter, a feminist, the independence icon and the anti-imperialist hero, and the man who spent 33 years in jail – Abdus Samad Achakzai, the Gandhi of Baluchistan.</p>
<p>In Pakistan, it often feels like the entire freedom struggle was fought by just two people: Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah and Allama Iqbal. It’s almost as if the nation believes that the entire fight for independence was won by a handful of men, and the rest were just there to hold the flags and cheer from the sidelines. But if we look a little deeper, we find that many other leaders, like Abdus Samad Achakzai, played crucial roles in shaping Pakistan’s history—though, of course, no one remembers them.</p>
<p>Abdus Samad Achakzai was a prominent leader and intellectual whose contributions to Pakistan&rsquo;s independence movement and political landscape are largely forgotten today. Born in 1917 in Baluchistan, Achakzai dedicated his life to advocating for the rights of his people and the progress of the nation. Despite his significant struggles and intellectual contributions, many Pakistanis are unaware of his life and legacy.</p>
<p>Achakzai was not only a political leader but also a thinker who believed in the power of education and activism. Growing up in a time when British colonial rule was still in place, he became involved in the nationalist movement at an early age. He understood that the future of his people depended on awareness and unity in the face of a changing political landscape.</p>
<p>He was deeply interested in history, politics, and philosophy, and realized that the issues faced by his people were connected to the larger struggle for freedom in the region. Achakzai admired the ideas of various political leaders, such as Gandhi, Nehru, and Jinnah, but he was critical of the direction in which the subcontinent was heading.</p>
<p>One of Achakzai’s most significant struggles was his opposition to the division of India and the creation of Pakistan. He believed that partition would cause division, suffering, and hardship for millions, particularly the Pashtuns and other ethnic minorities. Achakzai was a strong advocate for a united India, where people of all religions and ethnicities could coexist peacefully. His opposition to Pakistan&rsquo;s creation was grounded in his concern that it would divide communities, particularly in regions like Baluchistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where ethnic bonds were fragile.</p>
<p>After Pakistan&rsquo;s creation in 1947, Achakzai did not give up on his vision. He continued fighting for the rights of ethnic minorities, especially the Pashtuns, who he felt were being neglected by the new state. He believed that Pashtuns deserved more autonomy and better political representation. His activism also extended to Baluchistan, which had long been underrepresented in the central government.
Achakzai’s political philosophy was centered around social justice. He fought not only for political rights but also for better economic opportunities, education, and healthcare for his people. He saw the exploitation of the Pashtun and Baloch communities as a continuation of colonial oppression, and he worked to ensure that these communities had a stronger voice in politics.</p>
<p>However, Achakzai faced many challenges in his life. He was arrested and harassed several times for his activism, and his political views made him a target for those in power. Despite the pressure, Achakzai remained committed to his cause. His courage and determination earned him the respect of many, though his efforts often led to isolation.
Unfortunately, Abdus Samad Achakzai’s legacy has largely been overlooked by Pakistanis today. His intellectual contributions and dedication to social justice have not been adequately recognized. While figures like Jinnah and Gandhi are widely celebrated, Achakzai’s vision for a united and inclusive society is not as well-known.</p>
<p>Today, many Pakistanis are unaware of Achakzai’s life and the sacrifices he made for his people. His work and ideas should be remembered, as they offer valuable lessons for today’s society. Abdus Samad Achakzai’s life serves as a reminder of the importance of standing up for justice, equality, and the rights of all communities, no matter how difficult the struggle may be.</p>
<p>Achakzai&rsquo;s contributions to Pakistan’s political thought and his dedication to the well-being of all ethnic groups should be acknowledged. His vision for a fairer, more inclusive society is something that Pakistan can learn from today. By remembering his legacy, Pakistanis can better understand their history and the values that should guide their future.</p>
