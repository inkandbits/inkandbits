      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the mid-20th century, South Asia embraced Marxism as a political movement that supported proletarian class warfare campaigned to eliminate capitalism with an anti-bourgeoise stance. Marxism found its strongest reception among three major South Asian countries specifically Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh because social and economic imbalances created favorable conditions. This investigation focuses on how Marxism developed across the region while studying both its formation reasons and its contribution to political transformations and its eventual decline. According to the study, Marxism introduced reforms for workers and land distribution yet collapsed because of inner disagreements alongside state crackdowns together with the worldwide weakening of communist ideas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
