      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jhang, often perceived today as a modest town near Faisalabad, carries a rich historical legacy that contrasts its current image. Ironically, Faisalabad itself was once just a Tehsil of Jhang. Known for its deep cultural roots, Jhang is situated between two major rivers, the Jhelum and Chenab, which not only enhance its geographical importance but also contribute to its long-standing historical significance. In fact, Jhang is often regarded as the geographical center of Pakistan. In fact, much of the long-distance travels took place via Jhang before the motorways were a thing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
